# Dashboard-Site
 This Site should have been used to create a nice Dashboard for Quick Access. 

## Not Possible!!

 Sadly cause of Same Origin Issues, Cookie Issues and such this is not Possible in the way wanted.
 Since the Websites have Security Features to protect again Identity theft, that prevent this.

## A Compromise
 As a Compromise it would be Possible to expand this Layout still, with other Embeds and Direct Links as Quick-Access Site.
 This can then be used as the Home-Site of the Browser to Quickly see some specific things.
 But probably having a Script to open all the Websites isn't that bad either.
